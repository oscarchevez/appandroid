This app is a app made to mark the ending of 30 days of kotlin and was a long
standing side project of mine i am starting to complete every side project 
which i had and i didn't finish it :)

This project made by me directly influenced by the MusixMatch app which i use 
and love using. They have nice little functionality to create lyrics card from 
the songs you love listening to and get stuck in your brain. I intend to make it
somewhat like that while keeping it opensource and learn along the way while 
improving it.
